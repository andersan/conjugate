This project is envisoned as an extension of the functionality of conjuguemos.com, which
has high quality conjugation practice for a number of languages but which is lacking
in a couple main areas:

- audio practice (listing or speaking)
- mobile-friendly usage (apps or PWA)
- the meaning of the sentences/phrases being translated

The audio practice could be added with some APIs and made a premium feature.

The app could be made a PWA, solving the PWA issue.

To make the app more interactive, later more in depth statistics on the learner's errors
and successes could be used, in order to deliver more accurate practice words.

A SRS-like system for this would be cool.
